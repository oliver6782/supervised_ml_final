# Supervised Machine Learning Final Project

###  Traffic accidents pose a significant threat to public safety, resulting in injuries, fatalities, and economic losses. Understanding the key factors influencing accident occurrences can help in implementing effective preventive measures and improving road safety policies. This project aims to analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns and relationships between various contributing factors such as traffic density, weather conditions, and vehicle count. By leveraging machine learning models, we can develop predictive insights that assist policymakers and transportation authorities in mitigating accident risks.
